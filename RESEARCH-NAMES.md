## Top 10 Name Suggestions

### 1. **Conductor**
A conductor leads an orchestra, directing multiple performers to work in harmony. This name directly evokes orchestration and coordination—exactly what this tool does with AI agents. It's immediately recognizable, easy to spell, and has strong professional connotations.

### 2. **Ensemble**
An ensemble is a group performing together as a unified whole. This captures the collaborative nature of multiple agents working on a project. The name suggests coordination without hierarchy, which fits the distributed agent model well.

### 3. **Hive**
Evokes the collaborative intelligence of bees working together toward a common goal. "Hive mind" is already a familiar concept in tech, and the name suggests emergent behavior from multiple agents. Short, memorable, and has existing positive associations in developer culture.

### 4. **Chorus**
Multiple voices singing in harmony—a fitting metaphor for agents collaborating on code. Like an orchestra, a chorus requires coordination and timing. The name is elegant, easy to spell, and suggests unified output from diverse contributors.

### 5. **Fleet**
A fleet of ships or vehicles operating under coordinated command. This name emphasizes the multi-agent aspect and suggests mission-oriented collaboration. It has a professional, enterprise-ready feel and is commonly used in DevOps/infrastructure tooling.

### 6. **Loom**
A loom weaves multiple threads into a cohesive fabric—perfect metaphor for coordinating agent outputs into unified code. The name suggests both the technical (weaving/integrating) and creative aspects of software development. Short and memorable.

### 7. **Nexus**
A nexus is a central connection point linking multiple elements. This positions the orchestrator as the hub that connects and coordinates agents. The name sounds technical and professional, commonly used in developer tooling (Sonatype Nexus, etc.).

### 8. **Swarm**
Swarm intelligence is a well-established concept in distributed systems—multiple simple agents producing complex collective behavior. The name directly references multi-agent systems and is already familiar to developers. Short and impactful.

### 9. **Relay**
A relay passes work between participants in sequence or parallel, which describes how tasks flow between agents. The name suggests speed, coordination, and teamwork. It's professional and has positive associations with communication/networking.

### 10. **Symphony**
Like a symphony orchestra, this tool coordinates multiple performers (agents) to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The name suggests complexity managed through careful orchestration, with a polished, professional sound.
